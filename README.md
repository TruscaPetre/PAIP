## Goal
- Revolutionize AI by thinking from first principles
- Eliminate the Problems, Limitations of current systems

## Limitations & Problems of existing systems
- Creativity is limited
	- The capability of the system is bounded by the training dataset
		- Addressed a little bit by in context learning, but if the problem is too complex the system breaks
	- Doesn't Try new ways to approach a problem
- Stopping criteria for providing an answer is not sufficient. 
	- Stopping answering even if improvements can be made to the answer
- Not Treating ambiguity with asking questions
- Hallucinations
	- Doesn't know what it doesn't know, and tries to give answers even if it cannot
- Getting stuck in back and forth user interactions
	- Not being able to explain our problem in such a way that we get what we want out of the system. Ie The system is not capable of understanding the problem such that it can solve and deliver what the user wants.
	- They don't get bored
- Sycophant

## Principles for AI thinking
- Making mistakes even if giving wrong answers, being able to iterate on those and improve the answers, instead of doing one shot on the problem
	- This already a little bit addressed by OpenAI o1 and o3, deepseek r1 kind of models, so called reasoning models
- Looking at ideas with fresh eyes after some time.

## Theories about how to revolutionize
Working memory of humans is very limited, but context window, is very large for LLMs. Humans have developed other skills to deal with difficult problems which require a larger working memory. Those other skills, are like:
- abstraction allow us to solve problems which LLMs can't solve, 
	- deconstruction of the problem into smaller problems which are easier to solve
	- Analogy with - Chain of Thought 
- A problem can be solved in multiple ways ( Analogy with - Tree of Thought)
Theory: Maybe our limitations have pushed us to develop skills in problem solving which LLMs don't have by default


### Making models get bored
Such that they escape from the loops in which they get stuck.
