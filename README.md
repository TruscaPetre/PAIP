## Goal
- Revolutionize AI by thinking from first principles
- Eliminate the Problems, Limitations of current systems

## Limitations & Problems of existing systems
- The capability of the system is bounded by the training dataset
	- Addressed a little bit by in context learning, but if the problem is too complex the system breaks
- Creativity is limited
- Trying new ways to approach a problem, never tried by anyone

## Theories about how revolutionize
Working memory of humans is very limited, but context window, is very large for LLMs. Humans have developed other skills to deal with difficult problems which require a larger working memory. Those other skills, are like:
- abstraction allow us to solve problems which LLMs can't solve, 
	- deconstruction of the problem into smaller problems which are easier to solve
	- Analogy with - Chain of Thought 
- A problem can be solved in multiple ways ( Analogy with - Tree of Thought)
Theory: Maybe our limitations have pushed us to develop skills in problem solving which LLMs don't have by default


PDF - structure
- P = Problem / Pain , Goal, Need, Want
- D = Details / Data , Context, Constraints, Limitations, Prerequisites
- F = Fix, Solution, Value, Implementation
